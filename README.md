# Rosy-OS-Plus

Rosy OS Plus is based on a scratch project called Rosy OS. Codenamed Dragon.

I've seen the potentional of RosyOS. But I knew that Rosy OS will never be worked on again, So here comes Rosy OS Plus! :3

You can check out the original project here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/144553576

A love letter to all of the Scratch OS's out there. 

You may need to load most of these with PenguinMod (https://penguinmod.com/)
