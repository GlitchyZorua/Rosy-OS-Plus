# MOVED!!!

Hey, we've moved to https://github.com/GlitchyZorua/RosyOS-Plus!!

# Rosy-OS-Plus

Rosy OS Plus is based on a scratch project called Rosy OS. Codenamed Dragon. (styled as Rosy OS+, or Rosy+OS)

A love letter to all of the Scratch OS's out there. 

I've seen the potential of RosyOS. But I knew that RosyOS will never be worked on again, So here comes Rosy OS Plus! :3

(Codenamed: Dragon OS)


You can check out the original project here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/144553576
