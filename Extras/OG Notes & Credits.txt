Welcome to Rosy OS, an Operating System Simulator
~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
OS is an "Operating System" like Microsoft Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, etc. I've seen a lot of OS in Scratch and I've always wanted to create one with my way for fun, also I wanted to show the world that I'm actually capable of doing heavy scripting (even though it would take a really long time for me to finish (that's why I prefer making arts)) xD
~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
I think I started making this somewhere in February (2017), and procrastinated to the point I almost gave up, school has been really tight and I'm having a hard time to spare my time, "this is far from being finished" but I guess it's at least pretty decent to be shared, I will update this from time to time

Known bugs:

- It lags? well get a better computer xD I tried my best to make it as smooth as possible, really ;u; ~ (now that scratch has been updated to 3.0, the OS runs really smooth with almost no lag at all tho)
- Prior to 3.0, the assistant is completely broken and I'm still having difficulties in repairing it...)
- There are some graphical issues in the OS due to 3.0 update, and there's nothing much that I can really do about it... 
- You can't erase the word that you typed in the notepad (yet)
- Let me know if you have anything in mind

Special Thanks to:

@ZubStudios
He's the one who created most of the amazing sound effect in this project, without the sound effect, it won't be as powerful as it is now, also the original composer of the "Sakura" and "Ocean" song, which is used for the theme of the project. I really admire how he compose sounds, a professional composer!

@Mole_Gaming
For continuously giving me advice and support on the system, he actually tested every part of the project deeply and the only person that I know for doing so (most people tested in a flash and done), also the one who taught me programming since Colour Wars, I won't be able to make this if I never met him

a lot of people who tested my project in a different website via phosporus (so many that I couldn't write them all here, I'm sorry)

@OS_Green- for the green OS and @N25Games for the fiber OS.
These two OS were the OS that gave me the inspiration and most of the OS reference. Although I made my own interface, some part of project were derived from theirs, such as icons, categories, and assistant. Inspiration does not equal copying, I've improved the interface and apps in the project~ I admire their work since I won't be able to make this without them.

@IvyUI
for the live wallpaper concept, I implemented the idea and it looks beautiful, I hope your OS can be finished soon!

TheFatRat, Vocaloid, Pokemon, Fall Out Boy~

@Sensytive, @ScratchStang, @Mole_gaming, @LittLEMiSSBuTTerFLY, @Haudio for the quotes

and a lot more people that I probably missed ;u;
